# Steady
Self-Balancing Robot

This project aimed to design, construct and program a self-balancing robot. The following objectives have been set:

* Design and assemble the chassis of the robot
* Mount all the electronic hardware on the chassis and make all the electrical connections
* Develop the software to read from the sensors and to control the actuators
* Implement a PID controller to enable the robot to stay upright
* Implement a PID controller to enable the robot to return to move
* Develop the software for wireless control and camera streaming
